* Keep all your data at much lower cost

* Compliance requirement to keep your data (e.g., financial services industry)

* Need to show auditors that data cannot be changed or deleted

* Vault Lock - can use console, API or CLI

    * Deploy and enforce controls for a vault with a vault lock policy
    * Policies can be locked from editing
    * Policies cannot be changed after locking
    * Enforce compliance controls
    * Policies created using IAM

* [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html)

* [Example Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock-policy.html) - note that policies are applied in order, first policy takes precedence over the following policies

* Steps for Vault Lock

    1. Initiate Vault Lock

        * Attaches Vault Lock policy to vault
        * Lock is then set to an InProgress state, lock ID is returned
        * You then have 24 hours to validate the lock, or it expires

    2. Complete Vault Lock

        * Now goes from InProgress state â†’ Locked state (immutable)

**For the exam, know:**

* Vault lock controls - time-based retention, "undeleteable" or both in same policy
* Implement control using IAM policies
